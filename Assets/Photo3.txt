Our future...
We really thought about that alot
For starters, we always wanted to live together...
We've done that
What next...
We've always wanted to get married
We picked out the perfect place for it...
Priced it and everything...
We even picked out who was going to make the cake...
Your sister always made the best ones...
After that we wanted to start a family
You always wanted a big family...

Too bad none of that could happen...
You got sick before anything could happen...
It was only a few days after we moved into our first appartment...
"It's only just a cough, it'll be fine"... 
I remember you saying that so clearly...
It all went in so fast...
First it was just a cough then...
Rushed to hospital...
Turns out it was lung cancer...
You never smoked...
You always took care of your health...
But even still...
It finished just as quickly as it started...
One minute you where lying next to me in bed...
And the next you were dying in hosptial...
I wasn't there to hear your last words...
It was heart breaking to hear that you weren't with us...
I didn't know what to do with myself...
If only I noticed the signs sooner
Maybe you'd still be with us...
Yesterday was the funeral...
It made me realise how special I was to be able to spend that time with you...
It made me realise how much I loved...
Our Time Together
