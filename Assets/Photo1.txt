I remember that day we met fondly

Every time I tired to talk to you...
You'd just walk away

But I kept on trying, I couldn't stop thinking about you from the momment I saw you

I was scared at first...
What if you didn't even like me?
What if you had someone else?

Even so, after building up all that courage...
After waiting for so long...
I took a dive and told you how I feel...
I'm so glad that you felt the same
