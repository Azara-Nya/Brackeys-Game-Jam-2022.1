Moving in together at first was a challenge...
So much stuff to find a place for...

But if it ment seeing you each and everyday it was worth it

Living together made me notice another side to you...
But you're still the same person I fell in love with

Alot of this was really stressful...
But with you it didn't feel that bad

All of this made me realise how lucky I was have met you...
I wonder what our future might look like
